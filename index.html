              <h2>PSLV</h2>
              <p>
                Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is the third generation
                launch vehicle of India. It is the first Indian launch vehicle
                to be equipped with liquid stages. After its first successful
                launch in October 1994, PSLV emerged as a reliable and versatile
                workhorse launch vehicle of India. The vehicle has launched
                numerous Indian and foreign customer satellites. Besides, the
                vehicle successfully launched two spacecraft "Chandrayaan-1 in
                2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft in 2013"that later travelled to
                Moon and Mars respectively. Chandrayaan-1 and MOM were feathers
                in the hat of PSLV. The launch of PSLV-C48 marks the 50th Launch
                of PSLV. Besides, the vehicle successfully launched two
                spacecraft " Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft
                in 2013"that later traveled to Moon and Mars respectively

              <h2>GSLV</h2>
              <p>
                Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II (GSLV Mk II) is
                the launch vehicle developed by India, to launch communication
                satellites in geo transfer orbit using cryogenic third stage.
                Initially Russian GK supplied cryogenic stages were used. Later
                cryogenic stage was indigenously developed and inducted in Jan
                2014 from GSLV D5 onwards. This operational fourth generation
                launch vehicle is a three stage vehicle with four liquid
                strap-ons. The flight proven indigenously developed Cryogenic
                Upper Stage (CUS), forms the third stage of GSLV Mk II. From
                January 2014, the vehicle has achieved six consecutive successes

              <p>
                GSLV MkIII is configured as a three stage vehicle with two solid
                strap-on motors (S200), one liquid core stage (L110) and a high
                thrust cryogenic upper stage (C25). The S200 solid motor is
                among the largest solid boosters in the world with 204 tonnes of
                solid propellant. The liquid L110 stage uses a twin liquid
                engine configuration with 115 tonnes of liquid propellant, while
                the C25 Cryogenic upper stage is configured with the fully
                indigenous high thrust cryogenic engine (CE20) with a propellant
                loading of 28 tons. The overall length of the vehicle is 43.5 m
                with a gross lift-off weight of 640 tonnes and a 5m-diameter
                payload fairing. .
